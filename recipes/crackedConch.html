    <p>Cracked Conch is a must-have dish, when visiting the Bahamas.  Luckily for us Bahamians aren't the only ones who can make cracked conch.</p>
    <p>Below we have everything you need to make your very own cracked conch and enjoy it's fluffy and chewy delight.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Conch</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Complete Seasoning</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse Conch meat with warm water.</li>
        <li>Cut Conch into long flat pieces (however best you can).</li>
        <li>Using meat tenderizer, beat conch until it is soft and broken up into small pieces that are barely linked together</li>
        <li>Season conch with complete seasoning and then place in a container of milk to marinate for atleast an hour.</li>
        <li>Prepare a seperate bowl with eggs.  Mix eggs until yolk is dispersed throughout it.</li>
        <li>Once marinated, generously dip conch in eggs and allow to be fully covered.</li>
        <li>Once conch is drenched with egg, cover with a thin layer of flour (Try using a Ziplock pouch and shaking the flour onto the conch).</li>
        <li>Preheat cooking oil in a medium sized pot or deep fryer.  Once oil is heated enough begin placing battered clumps of conch into the oil</li>
        <li>Wait until conch is golden brown and crispy and then place on a plate or surface with a paper towel on top to let any excess oil drain off.</li>
        <li>And there you have it!  You can now enjoy your very own cracked conch, Bahamian Style.</li>
